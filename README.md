# eKV

Express KV is an overly simple key-value db

Please please please **please** only use this over your local network if your not going to add auth

Stupid like me? Simple but simple to understand "docs" located at <code>:1122/</code> of your project

# module.js

<code>module.js</code> contaisn a very simple & wasy way to use eKV without writing code yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I gotchu I'm also lazy

I said it in the file but I will say it here too.

"K & V should be explanatory but host should be set to http(s)://ip:1122"

<code>test.js</code> contains the functions of <code>module.js</code>
